INTRODUCTION

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. In this paper we are considering three image classification pre-trained models on Image Net dataset namely, VGG 16, Inception V3 and Xception model to compare their relative accuracy and maximize their individual accuracies by varying and selecting the best parameters and Fine Tuning the convolutional layer. 

RESEARCH OBJECTIVE

The objective of our project is to use the methodology of Transfer Learning to classify custom images and improve the accuracy by varying the convolutional network of a particular model
